This repository contains two advanced machine learning projects:

1. **NLP Project**: Fine-tuning of DeepSeek R1 (8B parameters)
   - Implementation of LoRA fine-tuning for medical question answering
   - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation with FAISS

2. **Computer Vision Project**: Vision Transformers (ViT)
   - Implementation and exploration of Vision Transformers for image classification
   - Transfer learning and fine-tuning approaches

Both projects demonstrate state-of-the-art techniques in their respective domains.
